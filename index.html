      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am taking UW Coding Bootcamp to initiate a career change! I have been coding online at free sites and it is a wonderful amalgamation of my artsy and organizational skills. I am looking forward to coding proficiently.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am born and raised in the Seattle area. I currently live in Maple Valley/Renton but I am looking to move (maybe even out of state) by early next year.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love to read fantasy, sci-fi, historical fiction and even cheesy romance novels! I bake and cook. I like to swim and surf. I watch too much TV for my own good but I delve deep into the fantasy worlds of Game of Thrones or whatever is catching my eye at the moment.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>If I could pick something and just be great at it and able to do it professionally I would probably be a dancer or stage actor/dancer!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Maple Valley/Renton, WA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I found a passion for it. I find it a great combination of elements I love at work--creating, designing, building...project based.</p>
